This is a Bicycle  project, containing a single class called Bycicle.
By creating an object of the class, you will be able to set and get 
different properties of a bicycle (e.g. model, number of chairings, etc.).

PROJECT TITLE: Bicycle.

VERSION or DATE: 25.01.2021
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:Open the java file, make an object of class Bicycle, and play around with different methods. 
AUTHORS: Liudmila Strelnikova (repository creator), Kailesh Sugumar.
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Try setting and getting the bike's owner, model, number of sprockets, chainrings, presence of hydraulic brakes,and mileage. Enjoy.
POINT DISTRIBUTION: Mila:15, Kailesh:5 (out of 20).

Add accessor methods for owner and model.
Add fields sprocketNumber and chainringNumber that will keep info about number of sprockets and chainrings. Add accessor methods for these two fields.
Add two methods that set the number of sprockets and chainrings.
Add a boolean field, hydraulicBrakes, This field records weather or not a bike is equipped with hydraulic brakes. The field should be set through a parameter to the constructor (and it is immutable). Provide an accessor method.
Add another integer field, mileage, that keeps track of the kilometres travelled by the bike.
Add a mutator, drive, that takes an integer parameter and increases the mileage by the value of that parameter. Also, include an accessor for mileage.
Add a method, printBikeInfo, to the Bicycle class. This should print info about owner, model sprockets, chainrings, brakes and the mileage (each on a separate line).
Add a method authorInfo that prints information about the author of each implemented method (each on a separate line).
